# PH3010 Solar Limb Darkening Mini Project

Royal Holloway University of London physics department - PH3010 Astrolabs mini project.

This project will focus on measuring the radiation of the sun at various points across the sun's surface. The result of these readiation measurements will aid in our understanding of the temperature of the sun as a function of its depth. Analysis of data recorded will invlove using the method of leas sqares to fit the data of a function outlining the centre-to-limb variation of intensity.

## Equipment used
This project uses the physics department's observatory - the Michael Gardener observatory - where we will be familiar with how to use the LX-200 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope.
